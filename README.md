## Instructions

I created the system using the latest version of the Laravel Framework. I used migrations to create the tables and all tables have the primary key UUDI as requested for you.
On this project, I used the PostgreSQL database and for testing the application I used Postman.

The endpoints are available in a separate file in public/files/endpoints.

PS: Prepare the file .env before running the command below, in order to run the migration correctly.

- composer update
- php artisan key: generate
- php artisan migrate
